    <h1> Array</h1>
    <p> JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:<p>
    <br>var car1 = "Saab";</br>
    <br>var car2 = "Volvo";</br>
    <br>var car3 = "BMW";</br>
    </p>
    <p>However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array! An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
